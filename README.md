## About

This is a small, vanilla-styled mod that adds a notebook to your GUI. You can use it to note down coordinates, or write notes.

It is simply just a book in your menus - with a couple added features.
This mod is **client side**; you do not need to install this on the server to use it - It is usable anywhere.
